Documentation: [API Reference](https://docs.rs/qubit-state-machine)

`qubit-state-machine` is a small Rust finite state machine crate for lifecycle,
workflow, and task-state tracking code.

It provides immutable transition rules, validation at build time, and a
CAS-backed `AtomicRef` for applying events to shared state.

## Why Use It

Use `qubit-state-machine` when you need:

- explicit finite state machine rules built from enum-like state and event types
- immutable transition tables that can be shared across threads
- build-time validation for unknown states and conflicting transitions
- event-driven state updates through `trigger` and `try_trigger`
- success callbacks that observe the old and new state after an update
- simple state tracking for services, jobs, devices, or UI logic

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
qubit-state-machine = "0.2"
```

## Quick Start: Job Processing

```rust
use qubit_state_machine::{AtomicRef, StateMachine};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
enum JobState {
    Queued,
    Running,
    Succeeded,
    Failed,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
enum JobEvent {
    Start,
    Complete,
    Fail,
}

fn create_job_machine() -> Result<StateMachine<JobState, JobEvent>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    Ok(StateMachine::builder()
        .add_states(&[
            JobState::Queued,
            JobState::Running,
            JobState::Succeeded,
            JobState::Failed,
        ])
        .set_initial_state(JobState::Queued)
        .set_final_states(&[JobState::Succeeded, JobState::Failed])
        .add_transition(JobState::Queued, JobEvent::Start, JobState::Running)
        .add_transition(JobState::Running, JobEvent::Complete, JobState::Succeeded)
        .add_transition(JobState::Running, JobEvent::Fail, JobState::Failed)
        .build()?)
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let machine = create_job_machine()?;

    assert!(machine.contains_state(JobState::Running));
    assert!(machine.is_initial_state(JobState::Queued));
    assert!(machine.is_final_state(JobState::Succeeded));
    assert_eq!(
        machine.transition_target(JobState::Queued, JobEvent::Start),
        Some(JobState::Running),
    );

    let state = AtomicRef::from_value(JobState::Queued);
    let running = machine.trigger(&state, JobEvent::Start)?;
    assert_eq!(running, JobState::Running);
    assert_eq!(*state.load(), JobState::Running);

    let mut audit_log = Vec::new();
    let finished = machine.trigger_with(&state, JobEvent::Complete, |old_state, new_state| {
        audit_log.push((old_state, new_state));
    })?;
    assert_eq!(finished, JobState::Succeeded);
    assert_eq!(audit_log, vec![(JobState::Running, JobState::Succeeded)]);

    assert!(!machine.try_trigger(&state, JobEvent::Fail));
    assert_eq!(*state.load(), JobState::Succeeded);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Build-Time Validation

Invalid rules are rejected before a `StateMachine` is created.

```rust
use qubit_state_machine::{StateMachine, StateMachineBuildError};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
enum JobState {
    Queued,
    Running,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
enum JobEvent {
    Start,
}

let error = StateMachine::builder()
    .add_state(JobState::Queued)
    .add_transition(JobState::Queued, JobEvent::Start, JobState::Running)
    .build()
    .expect_err("transition target must be registered");

assert_eq!(
    error,
    StateMachineBuildError::TransitionTargetNotRegistered {
        source: JobState::Queued,
        event: JobEvent::Start,
        target: JobState::Running,
    },
);
```

## Applying Events Without Error Handling

Use `try_trigger` or `try_trigger_with` when an invalid transition should be a
simple `false` result.

```rust
use qubit_state_machine::{AtomicRef, StateMachine};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
enum DoorState {
    Open,
    Closed,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
enum DoorEvent {
    Close,
    Reopen,
}

let machine = StateMachine::builder()
    .add_states(&[DoorState::Open, DoorState::Closed])
    .add_transition(DoorState::Open, DoorEvent::Close, DoorState::Closed)
    .build()
    .expect("rules should build");
let state = AtomicRef::from_value(DoorState::Open);

assert!(machine.try_trigger(&state, DoorEvent::Close));
assert!(!machine.try_trigger_with(&state, DoorEvent::Reopen, |_, _| {
    unreachable!("callback is skipped when transition fails");
}));

assert_eq!(*state.load(), DoorState::Closed);
```

## Common Next Steps

| Task | API |
| --- | --- |
| Define states and transitions | `StateMachine::builder`, `StateMachineBuilder` |
| Add one or more states | `add_state`, `add_states` |
| Mark initial and final states | `set_initial_state`, `set_initial_states`, `set_final_state`, `set_final_states` |
| Add transition rules | `add_transition`, `add_transition_value`, `Transition` |
| Query transition targets without changing state | `transition_target` |
| Apply events and get detailed errors | `trigger`, `trigger_with`, `StateMachineError` |
| Apply events without handling errors | `try_trigger`, `try_trigger_with` |
| Store shared mutable state | `AtomicRef` |

## Core API At A Glance

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Transition` | Immutable value describing `source --event--> target`. |
| `StateMachineBuilder` | Mutable builder for states, initial states, final states, and transitions. |
| `StateMachine` | Immutable, validated transition table used to query and trigger events. |
| `AtomicRef` | Re-exported atomic reference used for CAS-backed current state. |
| `StateMachineBuildError` | Validation error returned while building invalid rule sets. |
| `StateMachineError` | Runtime error returned when an event cannot be applied. |

## Project Scope

- `qubit-state-machine` is intended for simple finite state machines, not a full
  workflow engine.
- State and event types should be small enum-like values implementing
  `Copy + Eq + Hash + Debug`.
- Rule definitions become immutable after `StateMachineBuilder::build`.
- `trigger` accepts `AtomicRef<S>` directly.
- Event-driven transitions are installed through `qubit-cas`.
- Callbacks run after the CAS update has succeeded.
